# Reddit User Persona Analyser

A comprehensive tool that analyzes Reddit user profiles to create detailed user personas using AI/LLM analysis. This tool scrapes a user's posts and comments, then uses natural language processing to identify patterns in communication style, interests, values, and behavior.

## Features

- **Automated Reddit Scraping**: Extracts posts and comments from any public Reddit profile
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Groq's LLM to analyze content and generate detailed personas
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Creates detailed persona reports with citations and sources
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface with clear prompts
- **Privacy Focused**: Only analyzes publicly available Reddit content

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Groq API key (free tier available)
- Internet connection for Reddit scraping and LLM analysis

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Script

Save the Python script as `reddit_persona_analyzer.py` in your desired directory.

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv requests beautifulsoup4 langchain langchain-community langchain-groq pydantic
```

### Step 3: Get Your Groq API Key

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to the API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key for the next step

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your script:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.

**Alternative method**: You can also set the environment variable directly:

**On Windows:**
```cmd
set GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```
